What have I learned about building software.
- Build stuff with other people. (obviously)
- Build stuff by yourself.
- You need to believe that you can become comparatively productive in a software stack.
	- Have you ever heard of Rails? What was it comparatively good at?
	- You have three large pieces to choose
		- Present to user (web, mobile, hardware)
		- Logic (programming language or no/low-code platform)
		- Data Store (Database)
		- Maybe the last two bullets collapse into a BaaS like Firebase or Supabase
	- Are you motivated to learn it?
