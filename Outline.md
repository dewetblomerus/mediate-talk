Choosing a stack
- Have you heard of Rails?
- You have three large pieces to choose
	- Present to user (web, mobile, hardware)
	- Logic (programming language or no/low-code platform)
	- Data Store (Database)
	- Maybe the last two bullets collapse into a BaaS like Firebase or Supabase

- Can you get paid doing it?
- I chose Phoenix LiveView for side projects.
