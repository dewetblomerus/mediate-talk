# Building an Ai mediator

---

---

# Who am I?

- I am not an AI expert.
- I am an expert at building things.

---

# What did I build?

- Problem discovery story.
- Demo.
- Where I paused the project.

---

### What did I learn about building generative text applications?

- Use an API.
- Send the entire context in each request.
- Send a system prompt.
- Plan to swap out your vendor.

---

### What have I learned about building software.

- Build stuff with other people. (obviously)
- Build stuff by yourself.

---

### Choosing a stack of tools to build with

You have three large pieces to choose

1.  Present to user (web, mobile, desktop, hardware)
1.  Logic (programming language or no/low-code platform)
1.  Data Store (Database). Maybe collapse with previous bullet into a BaaS like Firebase or Supabase

---

### Choosing a stack (continued)

You have some small pieces to choose.

1.  Distribution, hosting. PaaS is really compelling for side projects. I like Fly.io
1.  Authentication/Authorization. Maybe separate bullets, maybe BaaS from previous slide.

---

### Choosing a stack (continued some more)

- Am I motivated to learn it?
- Do I enjoy working with it?
- Can I get paid doing it?
- Do I have or can I find a community?

---

### My stack

- I chose Phoenix LiveView for side projects.
- Then I found a job doing it.

---

### Now what?

- Go build a side project
- After you build one, cranking out one per year becomes less and less work.
